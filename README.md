# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project predicts which customers are likely to stop using a product or service (churn). Using historical customer data, machine learning models analyze patterns in behavior, demographics, and usage to identify at-risk customers. The goal is to help businesses retain valuable customers, reduce revenue loss, and improve customer engagement.
